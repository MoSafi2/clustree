# Glossary

* cluster resolution: upper case `K`, for example, at cluster resolution `K=2` data is clustered into 2 distinct clusters
* cluster number: lower case `k`, for example, at cluster resolution 2 data is clustered into 2 distinct clusters `k=1` and `k=2`
* kk: highest value of `K` (cluster resolution) shown in clustree
* cluster membership: the association between data points and cluster numbers for fixed cluster resolution, for example, `[1, 1, 2, 2, 2]` would mean the first 2 data points belong to cluster number `1` and the following 3 data points belong to cluster number `2`
