# Glossary

* *cluster resolution*: Upper case `K`. For example, at cluster resolution `K=2` data is clustered into 2 distinct clusters.
* *cluster number*: Lower case `k`. For example, at cluster resolution 2 data is clustered into 2 distinct clusters `k=1` and `k=2`.
* *kk*: highest value of `K` (cluster resolution) shown in clustree
* *cluster membership*: The association between data points and cluster numbers for fixed cluster resolution. For example, `[1, 1, 2, 2, 2]` would mean the first 2 data points belong to cluster number `1` and the following 3 data points belong to cluster number `2`.
